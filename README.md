# spyglass

A simple wrapper around SOD - An Embedded Computer Vision & Machine Learning Library, that provides
access to powerful low-level image manipulation routines, as well as high level interaction with
images using N-Dimensional Tensors from Bottle.

## Installation

You will need clang installed in order to build the sod library.

1. Add the dependency to your `shard.yml`:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     spyglass:
       github: crystal-data/spyglass
   ```

2. Run `shards install`

## Usage

```crystal
require "spyglass"
```

Currently, basic manipulations are supported:

```crystal
img = Spyglass::Image.from_file("rider.png")
gray = img.grayscale
gray.save("grayscale.png")
```

```crystal
img = Spyglass::Image.from_file("stop.jpg", 1)
binary = img.otsu
binary.save("binary_dilation.png")
```
